The weather and other environmental factors can impact quality of observations.

Each PANOPTES unit is equipped with a bunch of sensors that measure wind speed, ambient temperature, humidity and much more.

This repository contains the software that reads the sensors on each PANOPTES unit, and prepares data for analysis in Google BigQuery.
